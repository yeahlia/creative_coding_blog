# Missing by Rafaël Rozendaal
### How do I think the code works?
I think that the code first begins with creating a canvas that is dependent on the size of the window, as I noticed when I changed the window size, the amount of squares change. It then creates a 'grid' of squares (with the minimum being a 3x3 grid) with some of them being gray and some of them being colored. The colored squares then move one at a time across the gray areas, colored squares never overlapping with other colored squares.

I think they used a randomizer for the color of the colored squares, but kept it between certain choices to keep the aesthetic and colors that Rozendaal wanted. Then I think it creates a grid by drawing squares and then randomizes which one is animated.
