An aesthetic register refers to a visual or sensory experience that elicits a specific kind of emotional or cognitive response. It classifies styles, themes and approaches based on the types of reactions that art provokes.

In terms of _cute,._ it can have several characteristics which often creates a sense of playfulness or affection. This can be through childlike features, smallness/roundness, innocence, expressiveness or comforting.

# How I could make:
### Cute Visuals
I could use more bright or pastel colors which can create a warm, inviting and playful atmosphere as those colors (especially when paired together) is typically associated with children. I could use round and organic shapes with maybe particle or motion effects to create a cute aesthetic.

### Cute Sounds
High-pitched and playful sounds would achieve cute sounds. A higher frequency, short durations and kind of bouncy rhythms.

### Cute Interactions
I could also use some gentle, smooth and non-aggressive animations, kind of bubbly and playful. I could also use interactions like the user clicking something and it could trigger a cute visual or sound effect to enhance the cuteness of the piece.

### Plan for Assignment Task 1
I want to use mainly ellipses and round shapes to acheive Ngai's definition of a cute aesthetic, moving away from sharp edges and corners. My idea is for the users to be able to click onto the canvas and it draws a ellipse or organic shape and when the mouse click is held, the object grows. When it hits other objects or the edge of the screenm it will explode and play a cute sound (and maybe a cute animation for when it explodes but I'm not sure how possible that is with my skill level.) I want to use a pastel-y or bright color palette to reflect the cute aeshtetic as well.
