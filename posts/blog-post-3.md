An aesthetic register refers to a visual or sensory experience that elicits a specific kind of emotional or cognitive response. It classifies styles, themes and approaches based on the types of reactions that art provokes.

In terms of _cute,._ it can have several characteristics which often creates a sense of playfulness or affection. This can be through childlike features, smallness/roundness, innocence, expressiveness or comforting.

# How I could make:
### Cute Visuals
I could use more bright or pastel colors which can create a warm, inviting and playful atmosphere as those colors (especially when paired together) is typically associated with children. I could use round and organic shapes with maybe particle or motion effects to create a cute aesthetic.

### Cute Sounds
High-pitched and playful sounds would achieve cute sounds. A higher frequency, short durations and kind of bouncy rhythms.

### Cute Interactions
I could also use some gentle, smooth and non-aggressive animations, kind of bubbly and playful. I could also use interactions like the user clicking something and it could trigger a cute visual or sound effect to enhance the cuteness of the piece.

### Plan for Assignment Task 1
I want to use mainly ellipses and round shapes to acheive Ngai's definition of a cute aesthetic, moving away from sharp edges and corners. I want these shapes to move slowly around the screen and bounce off each other (and even have some physics when they bounce into each other if that is possible). When they bounce into each other I want a short, high-pitched sound to play, and possible even a mouse click sound, as if the blobs were alive. I want the user to feel like they are kind of in control, or like they feel affection or responsibility over them. I want to use a pastel-y or bright color palette to reflect the cute aeshtetic as well.
