#  Rafael Rozendaal's 'Surface' and How He Achieves a Cute Aesthetic Register:
### Visually
He achieves 'cuteness' visually, through its small, round and plump shapes. The coins are soft-edged circles, which fall under Ngai's description of 'cuteness' as a register. The bright and uniorm colors evokes a toy-like sense, while the repetitive and predictable motion makes the piece feel non-threatening because it follows a rhythmic movement.

### Soincally
This particular work my Rozendaal does not have any sound.

### Interactively
The simple interactivity (mouse click changes the colors of the coins to all silver) reinforces Ngai's idea that cute things invite the user to a gentle and non-threatening engagement. It's a binary and predictable interaction so it is predictable and creates a sense of ease and familiarity. There is no punishment or challenge when you interact with the piece, further enforcing cuteness through comforting engagement.
