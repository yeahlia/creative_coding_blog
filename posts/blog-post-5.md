# Rafael Rozendaal's 'Surface' and How He Achieves a Cute Aesthetic Register:

### Visually

He achieves 'cuteness' visually, through its small, round and plump shapes. The coins are soft-edged circles, which fall under Ngai's description of 'cuteness' as a register. The bright and uniorm colors evokes a toy-like sense, while the repetitive and predictable motion makes the piece feel non-threatening because it follows a rhythmic movement.

### Soincally

This particular work by Rozendaal does not have any sound.

### Interactively

The simple interactivity (mouse click changes the colors of the coins to all silver) reinforces Ngai's idea that cute things invite the user to a gentle and non-threatening engagement. It's a binary and predictable interaction so it is predictable and creates a sense of ease and familiarity. There is no punishment or challenge when you interact with the piece, further enforcing cuteness through comforting engagement.

# In Regards to Assignment 1, How Do You Plan on Achieveing the Aesthetic Register of Cute:
### Visually
To achieve the aesthetic register of cute, I plan to use a very pastel or de-saturated color palette that is pleasing to the eye, which I can use Adobe color to help me choose them. I also want to avoid using sharp edges and instead opt for organic and flowy shapes, to create cuteness through roundness. I want the circles to pulsate at different rates and different times, which is more cute than if it was all at the same time as it has variation. The pulsating I achieve will be cute as I will make the phasing between the minimum size and the maximum size a slow phase that kind of invites you to click on them. The background will be a simple, lerping-color-changing background that allows it to feel less static, and also complements the pulsating circles.

<iframe id="visual" src="https://editor.p5js.org/yeahlia/sketches/Y5SEfHsEg"></iframe>

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`visual`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width 

</script>

This is just a general idea of what I want, I think for my final assignment I would want the color changing and the growth rate to be slower, I feel like if it's this fast it won't be cute or calming, and instead more chaotic and stressful.

### Sonically
I want there to be a sound when the bubbles pop, preferably a sharp, fast and high-pitched sound. I don't want that sound to be threatening as I want to stray away from anything that might be seen as negative. I would also like there to be a sound that plays as the mouse is being clicked over a bubble, and maybe even a quick sound when bubbles are formed from the mouse click. These sounds will all be quick, and maybe the growing circle will get exponentially higher until it hits another circle, which will trigger another sound.

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`sonic`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width 

</script>
This one I found really cute actually, I like the sound that it makes when I press the circle. I made it so the sound would only be played if the user clicks within the boundaries of the circle, because that is what I want to do with my assignment.

### Interactively

Since long-pressing on the bubbles will allow them to grow, it gives a sense of ownership and control as the user feels like they are taking care of it, and letting it grow as big as possible. Being able to control the different sizes of the bubbles gives more of an interactive feel as the canvas is theirs to change. Being able to click new bubbles in and also remove bubbles (by growing a bubble and touching another) also allows them freedom to change the canvas to their liking, and arranging it in a way that is nice to the user. When it grows and touches another circle, they both disappear using alpha and they both slowly transition to complete transparency and fades out, making it a neutral, non-negative or threatening experience.

<iframe id="interactive" src="https://editor.p5js.org/yeahlia/sketches/6PlTul0mc"></iframe>

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`interactive`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width 

</script>

This one was the easiest, I just made a blank canvas and the user clicks the circles in. I could use this for my assignment and just adjust the parameters so that it could change sizes, can't overlap, etc.
