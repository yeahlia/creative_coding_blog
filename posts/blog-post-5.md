#  Rafael Rozendaal's 'Surface' and How He Achieves a Cute Aesthetic Register:
### Visually
He achieves 'cuteness' visually, through its small, round and plump shapes. The coins are soft-edged circles, which fall under Ngai's description of 'cuteness' as a register. The bright and uniorm colors evokes a toy-like sense, while the repetitive and predictable motion makes the piece feel non-threatening because it follows a rhythmic movement.

### Soincally
This particular work my Rozendaal does not have any sound.

### Interactively
The simple interactivity (mouse click changes the colors of the coins to all silver) reinforces Ngai's idea that cute things invite the user to a gentle and non-threatening engagement. It's a binary and predictable interaction so it is predictable and creates a sense of ease and familiarity. There is no punishment or challenge when you interact with the piece, further enforcing cuteness through comforting engagement.

### Visually
To achieve the aesthetic register of cute, I plan to use a very pastel color palette that is pleasing to the eye, which I can use Adobe color to help me choose them. I also want to avoid using sharp edges and instead opt for organic and flowy shapes, to create cuteness through roundness. 

### Sonically
I want there to be a sound when the bubbles pop, preferably a sharp, fast and high-pitched sound. I don't want that sound to be threatening as I want to stray away from anything that might be seen as negative. I would also like there to be a sound that plays as the mouse is being clicked over a bubble, and maybe even a quick sound when bubbles are formed from the mouse click.

### Interactively
Since long-pressing on the bubbles will allow them to grow, it gives a sense of ownership and control as the user feels like they are taking care of it, trying hard not to let it burst but letting it grow as big as possible. Being able to control the different sizes of the bubbles gives more of an interactive feel as the canvas is theirs to change.
