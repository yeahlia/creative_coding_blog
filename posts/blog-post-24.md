# Progess Update!!

My assignment is progressing steadly! I have built the core layout and established the transitions between screens and the dropdown menus (or dropup?). At this point I havent implemented the core functions yet, like displaying notes and scales, or even the recording function. These missing areas are critical to the tool's usefulness in my community of practice. Because of the live nature of my band, the recording function allows for the tool to be used on the fly.

So far, it reflects accumulative growth as I've focused on slowly layering components, and have coded it in a way which will support more advanced features later. It's growing omnivirectionally, with ideas like chord views or scale degrees being explored, but have ultimately decided to remove these features for now as they didn't align to the bands workflow for now. Making these changes is poart of a transofrmational shift in the project, streamlining the design to better reflect how we actually interact with each other within our community of pracice. The domain of my project is colaborative, but because I haven't fully completed the project yet, it is not fully operating in that domain yet.

The values of our practice, which are a supportive, non-judgemental, creative anvironment are shaping how I design interacions within by website. I want the final tool to suggest and offer guidance, rather than saying "this is correct, play it like this". I ant it to feel empowering and confident, rather than limiting. Until these core feature sare implemented, the project hasn't reached its full potential.
