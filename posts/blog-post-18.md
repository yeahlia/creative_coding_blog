 # Live Coding as a Community of Practice

### Links to Live Coding Content I Find Interesting 

[Gibber](https://gibber.cc/playground/index.html) is a browser-based platform where you can create music through code without needing to download anything. It’s very intuitive and encourages exploration, and is a pretty cool way, in my opinion, to create music.

[Hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/) is another browser-based tool that allows you to live code visuals. It’s user-friendly, lets you alter the background of the coding space, and feels open-ended and creative. 

[Algorave](https://algorave.com) is a global movement where live coders perform at electronic music events, using algorithms to generate sound in real time. It’s a unique blend of rave culture and creative coding, and is super impressive to see.

# Domain
The live coding community exists between of programming and performance. It brings together developers, artists, musicians, educators, and students who are all interested in using code as a tool for creative expression and learning. 

# Repertoire
The community’s repertoire includes custom tools like Hydra and Gibber, which are used to create live visuals and music, as well as event formats like Algorave, where those creations are performed live. The key aspect of this rpactice is that the process of coding is visible and shared with the audience so they can see the journey and experimentation behind it

# Values
Core values in the live coding community include transparency and authenticity since audiences are invited to see the performer’s raw process.  Improvisation plays a critical role, as performances happen in real time, and it's important to be able to adapt to the environment around you. The community is also rooted in open-source principles, with tools and performances often shared freely. Inclusivity is another central value, with a strong focus on making live coding accessible to beginners, young people, and those who might not usually feel confident in tech spaces.

# What are some discussions regarding the relation between cultural performance practice and:

# Young People's Intrinsic Motivations for Learning
Cultural performance practices like music, theatre, and art play a big role in encouraging young people's motivation to learn. These experiences sparks the curiosity, joy, and self-expression inside of them and are often more engaging than the theoretical and formula-driven approach tghat is oftne associated with traditional coding. Live coding is especially motivating because it’s creative and the results are immediate and rewarding.

# Education Systems and Pedagogy

In education, live coding supports participation and active involvement. It allows students to learn multiple things at once, like music and coding, while also making STEM topics more approachable through artistic and playful methods. It teaches both technical skills and creativity at the same time, encouraging collaboration and moving coding into a more expressive space.

# Discourse/Public Debate, More Broadly

Live coding also contributes to broader public discussions about who coding is for and what it can be. It challenges the stereotype that programmers are only logical or disconnected, instead presenting them as performers, educators, and artists. This shift helps make digital creativity more inclusive and widely accessible.

# Legislation

Live coding raises important questions about intellectual property, copyright, and creative ownership. Since many tools are open-source and performances can involve remixing or generating original content live, it’s not always clear how copyright laws apply. As the practice becomes more recognized, especially in educational and cultural spaces, it opens up conversations about funding, sustainability, and the need for legal frameworks that support collaborative and digital artistic practices.
