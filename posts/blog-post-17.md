# List 3 Communites of Practice I am a Member of:

### Family

The domain would be support, daily problem solving and gambling on games. Repertoire would be communication styles, family rules and habits, traditions. For values, a lot of trust, responsibility, loyalty and helping each other grow.

### My Band

The domain for my band would be making, practicing and performing music together. The repetoire would be rehearsal techniques, instrument skills, live performance strategies, sound setup, etc. We value creativity, collaboration and expression.

### Gaming Online

The domain would be playing games together, strategizing, competing and cooperating. The repetoire would be game mechanics, communication and tactics. We value teamwork, fun, and humor.

### Creative Coding as a Community of Practice

The domain would be coding as a creative expression, not just a tool. The repetoire would be libraries, generative systems, visual/audio programming, etc. It values creativity, curiosity and exploring new ideas.

# Brainstorm Ideas for Assignment 3

I really like the idea of creating a creative rehearsal tool, where we can generate random chords and set the key, tempo, loops, etc. which will be used so everyone can unleash their creativity, while being in the same key/chords. Since it will play/loop, it can also set the general beat, but the drummer could figure out her own flare while still being on time with everyone. I was tihnking this would be cool with pedals that everyone can see, and when we play something cool, we could press a button on the pedal which saves the audio from past minute! Is interesting because it helps with randomness, but also still some structure to hepl creativity emerge naturally.

Another oen for the band could be dynamic visual jamming, where its a visualizer that listens to live input, and moves and changes based on volume, pitch, beat, etc. Its cool because it gives immediate feedback and encourages experimenting with different palystyles to see what you can get and looks cool. It also would be cool for live gigs, to see how all the music blends together, and it won't ever be exactly the same

For gaming I can make a program where we each have our own avatar and it records gameplay and analyzes the sound based on if it sounds happy/sad/angry and shows the mood changes throughout playing. It can have like a counter to see how many wins/losses there are and would be interesting analyzing voices to fit emotions.

If you can't tell, I really like the idea of doing something with music. Anyways another idea is a pedal that 'glitches' or changes part of the sound. Like sudden distortion, suddent reverb, just random effects being added, This forces creativity and adaptability, and lets us practice for when things go unexpectedly when gigging live!
