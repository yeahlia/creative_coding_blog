# How Could I Incorportate WebRTC API or WebSockets API to my Assignment 3 Idea?
I could do a real-time collaborative jam assist. If multuple users could connect their devices and share  the key/scale they are playing in, their live audio feed (via WebRTC), a synced fretboard view showing each person's preferred scale or notes, and colour-coded fretboard overlays based on who is playing what. This could turn the original idea into a more networked musical collaboration app, like a visual jam session board. It could be an app for everyone in the band, not just the guitarist.

### Technical Aspects I’d Need to Learn:
### WebRTC (for audio/video):
•	How to capture and stream audio from multiple users in real time
•	Managing peer-to-peer connections (especially across unreliable networks)
•	Handling audio processing latency and quality

### WebSockets (for app sync):
•	Building a client-server model for exchanging key/scale changes in real time
•	Implementing a sync system for fretboard overlays between all users
•	Using a lightweight protocol (like JSON) for state updates

### What Else I’d Need to Learn:
•	Pitch detection to refinine the live key detection system
•	Music theory libraries to handle all scales and notes
•	UI/UX design for multi-user interactions
•	Possibly a backend with Node.js for WebSocket communication
•	Hosting and deployment, like using Heroku, Vercel or Firebase

### What the Project Gains:
The idea of mycelial creativity refers to a connected, decentralized, and organic creative ecosystem, which is exactly what my idea becomes with these technologies. Just like mycelium lets trees and plants communicate underground, my idea with WebRTC/WebSockets lets musicians communicate across their fretboards, sharing knowledge without having to speak the same theory language. Integrating WebRTC and WebSockets could transform my idea from a smart fretboard into a living creative network, enabling real-time, responsive musical play. By incorporating these tools, I’d be creating a truly mycelial musical experience; interconnected, responsive, and supportive.
