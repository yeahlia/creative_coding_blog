# Assignment Task 3 Plan

### Domain

The domain is live collaborative music making, specifically within a band context.

### Repertoire

Draws from what happens during shared pracices, like jamming without pre-planning strucutres.

### Values

Value of creative freedom, emotional connection and inuitive exploration.

### Code Explanation

Basically there will be 3 differnt screens, chord, scale and note view. There will be like a footer at the bottom with the buttons I can press. I will have arrays and keys for notes in a key, intervals and such. The actual scales can be built based on the notes in a key and the intervals so I don't have to write every single one. There will be a record function that analyzes audio and can guess the key based on that. There will be a reset butotn to reset all the choices, and settings to toggle color coded notes, labels and scale degrees.

### Practical Description

It's designed to sit nearby while the band jams. Although this is mainly for guitarists, the note labels can also help show what notes are in the key. It is supposed to help bridge the theoretical gaps between band members whhich allow for morea creativity, rather than stress about being in the wrong key, etc. It doesn't intterupt and offers on-demand insight. Can also qork as an aid when rehearsing or pracitcing alone.

Jamming in the dark
A quiet guide finds out key
The code hears our noise
