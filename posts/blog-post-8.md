### High Compressibility

High compressibility refers to a pattern that is regular, repetitive or predictable. This could be something like a checkerboard grid like so:

<iframe id="highCompressibility" src="https://editor.p5js.org/yeahlia/sketches/6PlTul0mc"></iframe>

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`highCompressibility`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width 

</script>

### Low Compressibility

Low compressibility refers to a pattern that is irregular, noisy or random. An example of this could be static like so:

<iframe id="lowCompressibility" src="https://editor.p5js.org/yeahlia/sketches/6PlTul0mc"></iframe>

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`lowCompressibility`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width 

</script>

### High Effective Complexity

High effective complexity is all about meaningful structure, kind of in the inbetween; aren't just noise but also isn't too repetitive. Natural forms lke trees, corals, rivers, are all good examples of this as they aren't really random, but they're not simple either. An example would be:

<iframe id="effectiveComplexity" src="https://editor.p5js.org/yeahlia/sketches/6PlTul0mc"></iframe>

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`effectiveComplexity`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width 

</script>

# Generative Art

Philip Galanter writes that "... some maintain that this notion of structure is subjective and remains in the eye of the beholder." Why might this be useful for the purposes of making generative art?

### How do the examples above support this?

In your third example, what concepts and code are responsible for creating structure, in this sense?

# Yehwan Song's World on a Wire

### How does this artist use structure and randomness to achieve effective complexity

Yehwan Song uses structure by having the websites layout and elements being generated consistently, having a framework that maintains coherence. However, randomness is used when the user begins interacting with the website. The content begins rearranging itself (within the generated 'grid'). This introduces an element of unpredictability, yet is not too chaotic that the user gets confused. Because of this, Yehwan Song acheives effective complexity, being in the sweet spot between chaos and order.
