### High Compressibility

High compressibility refers to a pattern that is regular, repetitive or predictable. This could be something like a checkerboard grid like so:

<iframe id="highCompressibility" src="https://editor.p5js.org/yeahlia/sketches/XiFBkHEQF"></iframe>

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`highCompressibility`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width 

</script>

### Low Compressibility

Low compressibility refers to a pattern that is irregular, noisy or random. An example of this could be random lines converging like so:

<iframe id="lowCompressibility" src="https://editor.p5js.org/yeahlia/sketches/0vbhjpBO9"></iframe>

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`lowCompressibility`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width 

</script>

### High Effective Complexity

High effective complexity is all about meaningful structure, kind of in the inbetween; aren't just noise but also isn't too repetitive. Natural forms lke trees, corals, rivers, are all good examples of this as they aren't really random, but they're not simple either. An example would be a recursive tree:

<iframe id="effectiveComplexity" src="https://editor.p5js.org/yeahlia/sketches/ISm3RiuZH"></iframe>

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`effectiveComplexity`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width 

</script>

# Generative Art

Philip Galanter writes that "... some maintain that this notion of structure is subjective and remains in the eye of the beholder." Why might this be useful for the purposes of making generative art?

### How do the examples above support this?
It is useful when making generative art because it encourages people to make their own interpretations of structure, and so could find meaning in different ways. It also encourages artists to embrace creative possibilities that could be made. For example, the grid of squares that I made for my example of high compressibility, some people may see it as boring or repetitive, while others might see beauty in order and symmetry. While for my random line example for low compressibility, it can be seen as pure noise or chaos, but some people might see it as an expression of energy or emotion. For the tree, some viewers might appreciate the structure and its use of recursion, but some people would see it more as an organic form with room for interpretations. Basically, vewers choose what is significant in a piece, and structure is subjective to each person.

# Yehwan Song's World on a Wire
### How does this artist use structure and randomness to achieve effective complexity

Yehwan Song uses structure by having the websites layout and elements being generated consistently, having a framework that maintains coherence. However, randomness is used when the user begins interacting with the website. The content begins rearranging itself (within the generated 'grid'). This introduces an element of unpredictability, yet is not too chaotic that the user gets confused. Because of this, Yehwan Song acheives effective complexity, being in the sweet spot between chaos and order.
