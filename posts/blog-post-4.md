# Kindred Spirit

### Describe Your Kindred Spirit

My kindred that I choose for this assignment would be nature, specifically everything in the ocean/aquatic.

### What is the Context of your Kinship?

Growing up in the Philippines, I was always near water and sealife, especially since my extended family are all people who love being in the water, whether that be snorkelling, diving, island hopping, etc. I feel a close connection to the sea, and feel at calm when I'm near water, a perfect kindred spirit to offer something to.

### What is Your Common Purpose

Both the ocean and myself can inpsire appreciation and wonder. The ocean nurtures life and is this vast sealife with many different aspects that make people appreciate its ecosystem and beauty. While I wish to inspire others with my art and creativity, and make people feel emotions when they see/hear my work.

### Who or What is Your Shared Challenge/Adversary?

I want to use Ngai's cute aesthetic register to show how vulnerable, yet beautiful the ocean can be (even if I don't specifically create the ocean). I want people to see it and see that my project uses the concept of cuteness as a form of resilience in a world that values power and efficiency. I want to celebrate the smaller aspects of life, down to the tiniest thing.

### How Would Your Kindred Spirit Relate to the Visual, Sonic and Interactive Elements of Your Idea
They would relate to the soft hues, but they would especially relate to the pulsating effect that I want to add. It is similar to the calming waves of the ocean, going back and forth, kind of like ripples. The smooth and gentle visual aspects reflects calm movement. My kindred spirit would relate to the sonic elements by my use of high-pitched, playful sounds that can sound like gentle ocean waves, or just evoke the same sense of calm. In terms of the interactive elements, my kindred spirit would relate through the growth of the bubbles. The user being able to click on it and make it grow could symbolize the growth and size of the vast ocean, while the collision and fading out symbolizes the unpredictability, and how small things can create big impacts.
