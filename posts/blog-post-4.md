# Kindred Spirit 
### Describe Your Kindred Spirit
My kindred that I choose for this assignment would be nature, specifically everything in the ocean/aquatic.

### What is the Context of your Kinship?
Growing up in the Philippines, I was always near water and sealife, especially since my extended family are all people who love being in the water, whether that be snorkelling, diving, island hopping, etc. I feel a close connection to the sea, and feel at calm when I'm near water, a perfect kindred spirit to offer something to.

### What is Your Common Purpose
Both the ocean and myself can inpsire appreciation and wonder. The ocean nurtures life and is this vast sealife with many different aspects that make people appreciate its ecosystem and beauty. While I wish to inspire others with my art and creativity, and make people feel emotions when they see/hear my work.

### Who or What is Your Shared Challenge/Adversary?
I want to use Ngai's cute aesthetic register to show how vulnerable, yet beautiful the ocean can be (even if I don't specifically create the ocean). I want people to see it and see that my project uses the concept opf cuteness as a form of resilience in a world that values power and efficiency. I want to celebrate the smaller aspects of life, down to the tiniest thing.
