# Manim (Python)

### Why Am I Interested in This Scripting Language

Manim is interesting because it lets me aimate math and conceptual ideas. It's really unique in its ability to visualize abstract concepts in a clean and customizable way, which is pretty helpful. I love visual expressions, so Manim seems like a perfect hubrid between that and technical detail.

### How Might I Use Manim in my Own Creative Practice

I could use it to create explanations visually for different processes or systems. Because it is also python based, I could incorportate external data or randomness into the animations which can give me a lot of control and room for experimentation.

### What are the Strengths and Weaknesses of Manim vs Other Scripting Languages

Manim is great for education and design-focused projects because of its high quality vectors, there is a lot of control over timing and layout and also supports Python libraries, which has large amounts online. However there is a steep learning curve and is pretty limited for real-time interaction, and is not really suitable for fast iterations or prototyping.

### What are the Strengths and Weaknesses of Manim vs Compiled Languages

Manim has faster iteration than compiled languages, is more expressive and has readable suntax and the built in animation classes makes complex animations easier to do. However, it has slower execution speed and not intended for live iteraction. Theres also long rendering time especially for big animations!
