# Should Inclusion Be Considered a Core, Structural Pillar of Creative Coding?

Inclusion is not just a value of creative coding, but a part of its structure. Often described as open and accessible, it fails in practice as many people are left out. Access to digital infrastructure is still unequal, like reliable internet, modern devices, and updated software. Without it, the ability to engage with creative coding is limited, no matter how "open" the tools are.

Learning barriers also matter as people are more likely to stick with coding when they’re intrinsically motivated; curious or creatively driven. But many learning spaces still focus on extrinsic motivations like grades or career outcomes. Adding to that, the exclusivity that comes with coding through the use of technical jargon and elitist norms, easily pushes people’s interest elsewhere.

Inclusion also requires policy support. Without strong digital literacy education and legislation to ensure public access and rights to use creative tools, many are shut out by default. At the same time, major platforms often operate under techno-feudalist structures, concentrating power and data in the hands of a few. This limits what creators can do and how freely they can share or own their work.
Even when better alternatives exist, network effects and switching costs make it hard to leave dominant platforms. That’s why tools working together, interoperability, matters. It keeps options open and lowers barriers for new users.

A lot of learning also happens outside formal institutions, on forums, in communities, through peer teaching. These extra institutional hubs are often more inclusive and responsive than traditional education. Critical posthumanities encourages us to value informal, community-driven ways of learning and to challenge who decides what coding means and who it includes.

For creative coding to be truly open and meaningful, inclusion needs to be built into its tools, communities, and systems from the start, not treated as an afterthought.
