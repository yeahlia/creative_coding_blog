# Unity Visual Scripting

### Why am I interested in this GPL

I'm interested in Unity Visual Scripting because it is part of the process of game design. Unlike traditinoal coding, I could build logic and interactive elements by connecting nodes. As an artist, I usually like doing things visually rather than just looking at blocks of code, so this feels more like designing a flow chart or story board. Since it is part of Unity, it feels more connected to what I want to do in the future which is sound design for games.

### How I Might Use This GPL in my Creative Practice

I could use Unity Visual Scripting for prototyping mechanics, building interactive installations or experimenting audiovisual interactions. Since it is node based, it is easier to iterate without getting lost in words, which is something I do have issues with.

### Strengths and Weaknesses of Unity Visual Scripting vs Other GPLS

Unity Visual Scripting is more geared towards interactivity and 3D environments and great for projects that incolve physics or scene transitions. It also has integration with Unity's tools and assets, which is huge. However, it doesn't offer the same depth of generative visuals or audio. There's also a steep learning curve if you're a beginenr and unfamiliar with Unity, and can get super cluttered for larger projects.

### Strengths and Weaknesses of Unity Visual Scripting vs Text Based Scripting Languages

Unity Visual Scripting is better for visual thinkers, and reduces syntax errors and can make debugging easier. It also encourages experimentation because it doesn't completely break the code. Howveer, it can be slower or less efficient for experienced coders, harder to version control or share logic to other coders and is less flexibly for complex projects and code.
